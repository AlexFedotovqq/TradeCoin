            The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) has revolutionized the
            financial world, allowing anyone to access a variety of financial
            services and investments without relying on a centralized entity.
            One of the most important aspects of DeFi is the ability to access
            liquidity and trade tokens in a secure and private manner. This is
            where XRC SWAPcomes in.

            Secure and Reliable: Building XRC-Swap Protocol for Automated Token
            Exchange
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-white">
            XRC Swap is a decentralized protocol for automated token exchange on
            XDC. It provides a trustless and permissionless system for users to
            easily swap between XRC20 tokens, as well as providing liquidity to
            other projects and protocols. The protocol was built using a
            combination of Solidity smart contracts and a React Framework
            Nextjs. The smart contracts handle the exchange of tokens, while
            Nextjs provides serves an decentralised application to an end user.
            The primary challenge faced while building XRC Swap was ensuring
            that the protocol was secure and reliable. The team had to ensure
            that the smart contracts were written in a way that would protect
            users from potential exploits and would handle unexpected errors
            gracefully. They also had to ensure that Nextjs was written in a way
            that would provide a secure and user-friendly interface for users to
            interact with the protocol.

            The team is proud of having built a secure, reliable, and

            plans to continue to improve the protocol and make it more secure
            and reliable. They plan to introduce new features that will enable
            users to access more liquidity, as well as providing additional
            security and transparency. They also plan to expand their platform
            to support more tokens and protocols, allowing users to access a
            greater variety of liquidity options.

              XRC-Swap decentralized Exchange on XDC Blockchain

          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-white">
            On the XDC blockchain, cryptocurrencies (XRC-20 tokens) can be
            exchanged using the peer-to-peer XRC-Swap. In order to promote
            censorship resistance, security, and self-custody, the protocol is
            built as a collection of persistent, non-upgradable smart contracts.
            It is also intended to operate without the use of any trusted
            intermediaries who might arbitrarily impose access restrictions. The
            XRC-Swap is currently open source and MIT-licensed. Once
            implemented, XRC-Swap in any version will always be operational with
            100% uptime as long as the XDC blockchain is active. How does a
            normal market compare to XRC-Swap? It is helpful to first consider
            two topics: how the automated market maker design differs from
            conventional central limit order book-based exchanges, and how
            permissionless systems differ from traditional permissioned systems,
            in order to understand how XRC-Swap differs from a traditional
            exchange.

            AMM vs. Order Book
          </p>
          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-white">
            The majority of openly accessible markets employ a central limit
            order book method of trading, in which buyers and sellers create
            orders arranged by price level that are gradually filled as demand
            changes. A system known as an order book will be familiar to
            everyone who has traded equities through brokerage houses. Instead
            of employing an order book, the XRC-Swap employs an automated market
            maker (AMM), also known as a constant function market maker. At a
            very high level, an AMM substitutes a liquidity pool of two assets
            that are both valued in relation to one another for the buy and sell
            orders in an order book market. The relative prices of the two
            assets change as they are exchanged, and a new market rate for each
            is established. Instead of dealing with specific orders placed by
            different parties, a buyer or seller in this dynamic deals directly
            with the pool. A rising number of parties are actively researching
            the advantages and downsides of automated market makers compared to
            their traditional order book counterparts. On our study page,
            we&apos;ve compiled a few noteworthy cases.

          <p className="mt-8 text-xl leading-8 text-white">
            The immutable and permissionless XRC-Swap is the second departure
            from conventional markets. The fundamental principles of XDC and our
            dedication to the ideals of permissionless access and immutability
            as essential elements of a future in which anyone in the world can
            access financial services without concern for discrimination or
            counter-party risk served as the inspiration for these design
            choices. The services provided by a protocol with a permissionless
            architecture cannot be selectively restricted as to who may or may
            not use them. Anyone may freely trade, offer liquidity, or establish
            new markets. Traditional financial services usually limit access
            depending on a person&apos;s location, level of income, and age.
            Additionally, the protocol is immutable, meaning it cannot be
            upgraded. No party is permitted to reverse trade execution, pause
            contracts, or otherwise alter the protocol&apos;s behavior in any
            manner.

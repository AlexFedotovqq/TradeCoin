# XRC-Swap

XRC Swap is a decentralized protocol for automated token exchange on XDC. It allows users to easily swap between XRC20 tokens, as well as providing liquidity to other projects and protocols.

# What it does
The inspiration for XRC Swap was to create an automated, trustless, and permissionless system that allows users to exchange tokens in a secure and transparent manner. We wanted to create a system that would make it easier for users to access liquidity and trade in a secure and private environment.

# How we built it
XRC Swap was built using a combination of Solidity smart contracts and a React Framework Nextjs. The smart contracts handle the exchange of tokens, while Nextjs provides serves an decentralised application to an end user.

# Challenges we ran into
The primary challenge we faced while building XRC Swap was ensuring that the protocol was secure and reliable. We had to ensure that the smart contracts were written in a way that would protect users from potential exploits and would handle unexpected errors gracefully. We also had to ensure that Nextjs was written in a way that would provide a secure and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the protocol.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of having built a secure, reliable, and user-friendly protocol for token exchange. We are also proud of having created a platform that provides liquidity to other projects and protocols, allowing them to access the necessary resources to grow and scale.

# What we learned
We learned a lot about smart contract development and XDC security best practices. We learned how to create secure and reliable smart contracts, as well as how to design an intuitive user interface for interacting with the protocol. We also learned how to provide liquidity to other projects and protocols.

# What's next for XRC-Swap
We plan to continue to improve the protocol and make it more secure and reliable. We plan to introduce new features that will enable users to access more liquidity, as well as providing additional security and transparency. We also plan to expand our platform to support more tokens and protocols, allowing users to access a greater variety of liquidity options.
